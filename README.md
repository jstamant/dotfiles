These are my personal configuration files. Please feel free to use them or
browse them. Until recently, I've used Arch, GNU Guix, and NixOS. But now I'm on
Fedora and thoroughly enjoying everything...just working. See the tag
[*nixos-desktop-last*](https://github.com/jstamant/dotfiles/tree/nixos-desktop-last)
for the last commit I made on NixOS before nuking this repo.

If you're looking for my custom Emacs configuration, it's located in [its own
repository](https://github.com/jstamant/.emacs.d).
